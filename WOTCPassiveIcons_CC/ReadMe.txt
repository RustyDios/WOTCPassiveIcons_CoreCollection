[h1] What is this mod? [/h1]
This was a 'cloned version' of my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859762491] Passive Icons [/url] mod, stripping out any config options and gameplay changes.

This version has pretty much been rewritten, cleaned and optimized by Iridar for inclusion into the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2165341111] Core Collection[/url]

[b]Includes icons for;[/b]
Stasis Vest, Hellweave Vest, Hazmat Vest, (Passive) Wall Phasing/Wraith, Mindshields, Medikits, NanoMedikits, SkullMine (Icon Swap), Low Visibility (Icon Swap), Melee Resistance (Icon Colour Swap), Sustaining Sphere (Icon Colour Swap), Holy Warrior (Icon Colour Swap) Icarus Vault (Icon Colour Swap), Ruler Armour Passive Panic

[b]Includes icons for 'popular' mods;[/b]
For these mod added item icons I did not seek permission from the original mod creators, if any mod creator wishes for me to remove a passive icon for your item please let me know.
On a similar note if anyone has a mod added item that grants a passive ability/immunity that does not have an icon, please let me know and I'll try to add one in.

ADVENT Drones Anti-Stun Vest, Flame Viper Vest, Valentines Viper Vest, Bio Division 2.0 Vests, BioMedikits, CX Frost Vest, CX Wraith Vest, Bitterfrost Protocols Frostweave, Advanced Mindshield, Refraction Fields Immunities, Metal over Flesh Shields (Icon Swap), GTS SPARK Perks Regeneration (Icon Swap), CX HIVE Wall Climb, Corrupt Avatar Phantom Vest, Walker Servos.

Localizations for the passive display will use either the ability text or the item that grants the ability text.

[h1]Bonus Changes;[/h1]
[list]
[*]NONE
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility;[/h1]
Should work fine mid campaign, but maybe not mid-tactical.

Not be used with the original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1859762491] Passive Icons [/url].
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1133528728] ADVENT Avengers Ability Tweaks[/url] will likely clash.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1731235406] Bio Division 2.0[/url] changes how Medikits work. Part of this change removes the immunity to poison they grant. This also handily removes my Passive Icon too.

[h1]Credits and Thanks to;[/h1]

The XCOM2 modders discord for being a general awesome helpful bunch of people

Iridar for asking for this version to be made, specifically for inclusion into the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2165341111] Core Collection [/url] and for helping me to rewrite the mod from the ground up.
